Understanding work flow
=======================

This is an essential guide for contributors who want to understand
work flow that supports this project. Before reading further,
contributors are expected to have some knowledge of [Git] and
[GitHub Flow].

Git or GitHub
-------------

When working on project that is hosted on GitHub, contributors have
choice to use either Git program or GitHub web service. GitHub web
service could do most of things that Git program can do. Therefore,
contributors might prefer to use GitHub web service for common tasks.

Except for uploading files to the repository, Git program may be
preferred. This becomes more apparent when making changes to multiple
files, as well as making changes to files that cannot be edited by
online text editor.

GitHub (since early 2016) can now upload files by drag-and-drop or by
using 'Upload files' button. This might be preferred by contributors
to upload files without making changes.
