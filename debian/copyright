Comment: History of development and ownership
 .
 Customizer is copyright by Ivailo Monev, et al.
 .
 From 2010 to 2013, Customizer was developed and maintained by Ivailo Monev
 and few contributors. The program was initially written in Bash, Zenity
 and Gambas. In 2012, Gambas 3 port was created by Thiago Abreu (pr#17).
 .
 In 2013, Ivailo Monev had transferred the ownership of repository to 
 Mubiin Kimura. Development was less active until late 2014.
 .
 In 2015, Customizer was rewritten in Python by Ivailo Monev. In same year,
 Python 3 support was added by Graham Cantin (pr#110) while continue to
 depend on Python 2.7.
 .
 From 2016, Customizer was forked and maintained by Graham Cantin with no
 further planned migration. As a result, Customizer has two sources: the
 official fork that handles future development and the original repository
 that is considered as "old stable".
