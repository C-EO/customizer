to build your own remix with a few mouse clicks.

Development
-----------

Customizer is stable and not under active development.

For enquiries and feedback, refer to [contributing] guidelines.

The original repository is kept as "old stable", which is subject to
tentative updates of bug fixes and clean up. Recent releases require
Python 2.7 and Qt 4, and support remastering up to Ubuntu 14.04.

Future development has moved to the fork, which aims to migrate the
code to Python 3 and Qt 5. The fork is optimized for remastering
64-bit ISO images and will support newer releases of Ubuntu.
